# pynams
Process and interpret FTIR spectra with emphasis on water in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs)

pynams includes tools for plotting FTIR spectra, drawing linear and quadratic baselines, determining the resulting area under the curves, syncing with Matlab code for peak fitting, estimating water concentrations, and handling diffusion profile data, including that from uncut ("whole-block") samples. Simple examples for using this code are available  [here](https://github.com/EFerriss/pynams/blob/master/EXAMPLES.ipynb), and more advanced examples are provided in the [HydrogenCpx](https://github.com/EFerriss/HydrogenCpx) project repository. You can also contact me directly.
