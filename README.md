# pynams
Process and interpret FTIR spectra with emphasis on water in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs)

pynams.py includes tools for plotting FTIR spectra, drawing linear and quadratic baselines, determining the resulting area under the curves, syncing with Matlab code for peak fitting, and estimating water concentrations.

Functions for handling diffusion profile data, including that from uncut ("whole-block) samples, will be developed in wholeblock.py. For a desciption of the whole-block method see Ferriss et al. 2015 in American Mineralogist or contact Elizabeth Ferriss at ferriss@ldeo.columbia.edu
