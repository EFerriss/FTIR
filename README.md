# pynams
Process and interpret FTIR spectra with emphasis on water in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs)

pynams includes tools for plotting FTIR spectra, drawing linear and quadratic baselines, determining the resulting area under the curves, syncing with Matlab code for peak fitting, estimating water concentrations, and handling diffusion profile data, including that from uncut ("whole-block") samples. Instructions and examples are coming in the ipython notebook pynams.ipynb in this repository and in my CpxCode repository. You can also contact me directly. For a desciption of the whole-block method see Ferriss et al. 2015 in American Mineralogist.
