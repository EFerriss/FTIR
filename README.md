# pynams
Process and interpret FTIR spectra with emphasis on water in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs)

pynams includes tools for plotting FTIR spectra, drawing linear and quadratic baselines, determining the resulting area under the curves, syncing with Matlab code for peak fitting, estimating water concentrations, and handling diffusion profile data, including that from uncut ("whole-block") samples. Examples are available in the ipython notebook EXAMPLE.ipynb in this repository and in the HydrogenCpx repository. You can also contact me directly.
