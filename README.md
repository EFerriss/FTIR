# FTIR
Process and interpret FTIR spectra with Python with emphasis on water in nominally anhydrous minerals

This module includes tools for plotting FTIR spectra, drawing linear and quadratic baselines, and determining the resulting area and water concentrations. Eventually it will also include the whole-block method from Ferriss et al. 2015 in American Mineralogist.
