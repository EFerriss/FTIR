# pynams
Process and interpret FTIR spectra with emphasis on water in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs)

pynams includes tools for plotting FTIR spectra, drawing linear and quadratic baselines, determining the resulting area under the curves, syncing with Matlab code for peak fitting, estimating water concentrations, and handling diffusion profile data, including that from uncut ("whole-block") samples. Instructions and examples are comingthe ipython notebook pynams.ipynb in this repository.

For help using this codecontact Elizabeth Ferriss at ferriss at ldeo.columbia.edu. For a desciption of the whole-block method see Ferriss et al. 2015 in American Mineralogist.

Please cite this code. DOI coming.
