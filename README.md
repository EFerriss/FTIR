# pynams
Process and interpret FTIR spectra with emphasis on water in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs)

Pynams includes tools for
* Plotting FTIR spectra
* Drawing linear and quadratic baselines
* Determining the resulting area under the curves
* Syncing with Matlab code for peak fitting
* Estimating water concentrations
* Handling diffusion profile data, including that from uncut ("whole-block") samples  
 
Here are [simple examples and explanations](https://github.com/EFerriss/Pynams/blob/master/pynams/EXAMPLES.ipynb). For more advanced examples, check out the [HydrogenCpx project](https://github.com/EFerriss/HydrogenCpx). You can also [contact me](mailto: elizabeth.ferriss@gmail.com) directly.
