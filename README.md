# pynams
Interpret [FTIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform_infrared_spectroscopy) profiles with emphasis on water in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs)

Pynams includes tools to
* Create consistent baselines for groups of FTIR spectra
* Determine and plot integrated areas across profiles
* Estimate water concentrations
* Handle peak-specific data
* Model diffusion in 1D and 3D
 
Here are [some examples](https://github.com/EFerriss/Pynams/blob/master/EXAMPLES.ipynb). The examples file doubles as a test file, so if you change anything in the code, it's a good idea to try re-running it to make sure you didn't break anything.
