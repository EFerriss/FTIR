# pynams
Process and interpret FTIR spectra with emphasis on water in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs)

Pynams includes tools for
* Plotting FTIR spectra
* Drawing linear and quadratic baselines
* Determining the resulting area under the curves
* Syncing with Matlab code for peak fitting
* Estimating water concentrations
* Handling diffusion profile data, including that from uncut ("whole-block") samples  
 
Here are [simple examples and explanations](https://github.com/EFerriss/Pynams/blob/master/EXAMPLES.ipynb) in a jupyter notebook. That file also doubles as a test file, so if you change anything in the code, it's a good idea to try re-running the jupyter notebook to make sure you didn't break anything. 

You can [contact me](mailto: elizabeth.ferriss@gmail.com) directly with questions.  :)
