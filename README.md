# pynams
Process and interpret FTIR spectra with emphasis on water in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs)

Pynams includes tools for
* Interpeting H profiles based on FTIR spectra 
* Creating consistent baselines across profiles
* Determining and plotting integrated areas across profiles
* Estimating water concentrations
* Working with peak-specific data
* Modeling diffusion in 1D and 3D
 
Here are [simple examples and explanations](https://github.com/EFerriss/Pynams/blob/master/EXAMPLES.ipynb) in a jupyter notebook. That file also doubles as a test file, so if you change anything in the code, it's a good idea to try re-running the jupyter notebook to make sure you didn't break anything. 

You can [contact me](mailto: elizabeth.ferriss@gmail.com) directly with questions.
